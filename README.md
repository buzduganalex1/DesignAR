# DesignAR
This is a video platform for viewing videos with people's designs.


## Description

The ideea of the application came from the need of empowering people of the community with the design decisions regarding they surroundings. We tried to create an application that can be used both by the city designers but also by the people from the community to vizualize better how the community could look like.

The concept is that people can use their mobile phones to place virtual objects and decorate a piece of land in ways they would like them to be. For example they can see an area of land an think that there could be a nice park, and place benches and garbage bins, lamps, trees, art and flowers.

The municipality can see those videos and use them as inspiration for the real life projects and create a park that was voted and designed by the community, or at least draw inspiration from that so that the community designer can create better designs.

The people can film their creations and  post them on a video platform where other people can see them on the map and rate them, so that the best designs for an area can be used by the municipality.

## Extensibility 

Placing object in augmented space can have multiple applications like placing furniture in an home, or decorating an yard with pieces of art. Vizualizing how something looks like before actually starting a project is really helpfull and can reduce the costs and increase the engagement of the community.

Ideally the technology could be used to create art expositions in Virtual space and define the concept of smart park where events can be triggered by walking past objects, virtual objects that create a better viewing experience can be placed inside the park, decoration, and even animations can be created. The app could be used for measuring, planning, vizualizing and engaging the community to design their surroundings.
